# tsec samples

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This repository contains the sample files demonstrating configuring and using
[tsec](https://gitub.com/googleinterns/tsec).

## Info

One thing to note is that the project installs TypeScript in the root folder so that you can select a workspace version of TS when openng the folder as workspace. The subdirectories might depend on TS (e.g. `fixer` directory), but the dependency is not listed there to avoid having two versions of TS in the project.
